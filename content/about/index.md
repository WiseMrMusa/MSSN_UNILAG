# About Us

The yen for a platform and recognized body through which Muslims could come together, engage in discourses that sought to change status-quos and provide ideas for national growth inspired the cofounders of the Muslim Studentsâ€™ Society of Nigeria to establish the body. Since its creation in 1954, the body has become affliated with numerous colleges and institutions of which the University of Lagos is not excluded.

We are a band of Muslim students in the University of Lagos who have come together to foremost, constantly remind ourselves of the essence of our creation. Also, our union seeks to instill brotherhood in the hearts of our members.

Over the years, we have been grooming participants to be true vicegerents of Allah on earth and upright representatives of Islam. Many have learnt leadership skills working under the society and followers are being taught the 'Art of Togetherness' to better the face of the society and make things thrive.
